# ðŸ§¬ Protein Subcellular Localization Prediction

This repository contains a deep learning project designed to predict protein subcellular localization using neural networks (Dense Model, CNN, ResNet). The models are trained on protein sequences to classify them into 10 possible localization categories. Subcellular localization refers to the specific location or environment within a cell where a protein resides. Correctly identifying this is essential for understanding the protein's function and role in biological processes. 

## ðŸ’» Usage

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the environment file provided:

```bash
conda create --file environment.yml
```
